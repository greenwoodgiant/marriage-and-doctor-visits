					<h1>States that wait to get Married don't wait to see the Doctor (and vice versa)</h1>
					<p>---</p>
					<p>Oddly enough, there is a very strong correlation between the 
median age at which people get married and the rate at which people have
 gone 5 or more years since their last doctor's visit.</p>
					<p>Age used is average of Male and Female Median Ages at First Marriage for the year 2014.</p>
					<p>For the percentage, respondents were asked how long it had been 
since their last doctor's visit, and given the options 'under 1 year', 
'under 2 years', 'under 5 years', '5 years or more', and 'Never been'. 
Percentage shown is the number of "5+ years" and "Never" responses 
compared to the total number of responses for each state.)</p>
					<p>There are three fairly distinct groupings of states: High Age of
 Marriage / Low Rate of 5+ Years, vice versa, and the middle ground.</p>
					<p>The first group is comprised of New England and Puerto Rico, 
where the youngest median age is just shy of 30 at 29.5 (Maryland), and 
the highest rate is a hair over 5% (New Jersey). States where people are
 waiting until their 30's to get hitched are far more likely to have 
seen a doctor within the last 5 years.</p>
					<p>On the other side of the graph are mostly Rural and/or 
Midwestern states, where ages range from 25-27 and rates are all over 
10%.</p>
					<p>The remaining states hover between 5-10% response rate and 
between 26-29 for the first marriage, but remove only a handful of 
outliers, and there is a fairly clear trendline that slopes down in age 
as the response percent rises.</p>
